## Introduction

Hello!! I am Parv Patel(002845159). This project is a simple **Roll-a-Ball** game developed in Unity as part of a Building Virtual Environment Course CSYE7270. In this game, the player controls a ball that moves around a platform, collecting pickups, dashing through breakable walls, and managing health. The game also features a start screen and a restart level mechanic upon death.
